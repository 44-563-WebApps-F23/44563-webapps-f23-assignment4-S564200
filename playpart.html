<pre>
<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
see it until this evening, when it is dressed.
_[To the PORTER, takingout her purse.]_ How much?</p>


<h6>PORTER.</h6>
<p>Sixpence.</p>

<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>There is a shilling. No, keep the change. _[The PORTER thanks her, and
goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
listens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
right.]_</p>

<h6>HELMER.</h6>
<p>_[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
there?</p>

<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>_[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!</p>

<h6>HELMER.</h6>
<p>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>Yes!</p>

<h6>HELMER.</h6>
<p>When did my squirrel come home?</p>

<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

<h6>HELMER.</h6>
<p>Don’t disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>

<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>

<h6>HELMER.</h6>
<p>Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>

<h6>NORA.</h6>
<p>Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money.</p>

<h6>HELMER.</h6>
<p>Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is due.</p>
